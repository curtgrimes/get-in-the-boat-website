# "Get in the Boat" Website

The source for the "Get in the Boat" website located at https://getintheboatbook.com/. This is a Nuxt 3 project.

In "Get In The Boat", Darlene Fuchs shares the powerful and poignant story of her father Richard's experience as a caregiver to his wife Gail during her decline into dementia. This memoir, based on the journals of Richard Sonnichsen, is a heart-wrenching yet inspiring exploration of the enduring power of love, faith, and resilience in the face of life's most difficult challenges.
