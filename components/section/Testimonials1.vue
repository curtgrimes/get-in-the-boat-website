        As a neurologist, I observe many patients and their families enduring
        the devastating effects of dementia. Darlene has captured the essence of
        the experience of the family members who have chosen to navigate the
        course of the complex illness with love and respect.
        <em>Get in the Boat</em> is a fascinating story of human resilience in
        the face of uncharted waters. I highly recommend it.

          The book beautifully captures the essence of meeting people with
          dementia where they are in the present moment. It emphasizes the
          importance of genuine connection, understanding, and love throughout
          the journey. It reminds us that despite the difficulties, those living
          with dementia can still lead fulfilling lives as long as we are
          willing to get in the boat.
