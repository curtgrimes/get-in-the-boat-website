          A woman who has lived for more than six decades, Darlene's life has
          been marked by various experiences, including ups and downs, twists,
          and turns. She has been married to her soulmate for over 40 years and
          has authored a memoir titled "Get In The Boat," which chronicles the
          heart-wrenching dementia journey of her parents, Richard and Gail, who
          complemented each other perfectly.

          Following Gail's dementia diagnosis, Richard became her primary
          caregiver, showing extraordinary affection and unwavering commitment
          to his beloved wife. Richard's passion for journaling later became a
          source of comfort and connection for the entire family. Darlene knew
          that her parents' story was worth sharing and wanted to honor their
          legacy by showing the world what love and devotion looked like even in
          the face of adversity. Drawing on Richard's daily journal entries, she
          weaves a powerful narrative of hope, faith, intimacy, and grief as her
          father balances his wife's needs with the joys and challenges of
          everyday life. Darlene poured her heart and soul into writing their
          compelling story.

          "Get In The Boat" is a powerful and poignant memoir that captures the
          impact of dementia on her parents' lives and their family. It is a
          story of resilience in the face of life's most difficult encounters.
          It narrates the tale of a man who loved his wife so much that he
          confronted the complexities of caring for a loved one with a
          life-altering affliction, while experiencing the spiritual strength
          that sustained him through the most trying of times. It also recounts
          the story of a woman who left an indelible mark on their lives but was
          taken away too soon.

          The author was devastated by the loss of her youngest grandchild,
          Noah, at the age of 3-1/2. However, she found solace in the fact that
          her parents had been reunited with him in heaven. Their love and faith
          had prepared them for that moment, just as it had prepared them for
          the journey through dementia.
