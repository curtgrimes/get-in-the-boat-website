        <em>Get In the Boat</em>, a caregiverâ€™s journal turned memoir, tells us
        exactly how a caregiver lives and feels yet still gives us something
        positive to hold on to. Giving us a behind-the-scenes look at the daily
        roller coaster of emotions a caregiver lives through is not only honest,
        it's refreshing. In a world where honesty often seems to be synonymous
        with sadness, this memoir stands out by presenting the raw realities of
        caregiving without overwhelming the reader with despair.

        <em>Get In The Boat</em> is a true gem for caregivers, offering an
        abundance of wisdom, no matter where you are on your caregiving journey.
        Having spent 10 years in the senior caregiving community, I was
        absolutely captivated by the fresh insights and reassuring advice this
        book provides in navigating the complexities of dementia care.
